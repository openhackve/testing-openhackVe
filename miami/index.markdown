### Info

MacBooks and mojitos. OpenHack Miami meets in [The Grove Spot](http://grovespot.com/) on most Mondays at 7:30pm.

* You can hack on anything! Any language, framework, public/open-source, personal, etc.
* Skill level doesn't matter. We don't care if you're working on Hello World or on increasing your wizarding level.
* You don’t have to have an idea to hack on! You’re more than welcome to come just to pair with someone.

Follow [@OpenHackMia](http://twitter.com/openhackmia) for announcements.
