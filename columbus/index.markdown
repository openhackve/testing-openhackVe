### Info

[Neo](http://www.neo.com) hosts an OpenHack night every other 
week in our Columbus office.  We welcome all skill levels and development 
platforms.  Come to get help on a problem, mentor a junior dev, or just hack.

We supply the pizza. Please bring a beverage to share if you're the beverage 
type.

### Next meetup

Our hack nights are every other week on Thursdays, from 6:30pm to 9pm. Check our
